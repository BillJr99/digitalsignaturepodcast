Link Rot is an experiment we're running to explore the format of podcasting. We're hugely interested in technology but also the impact that it's having on our lives - and we wanted to talk about that. There's something about a discuss that brings people together to jointly explore a topic. We can gain a different perspective, and there's something more personal doing it through speech. 

### The Name

As Wikipedia puts it:

>**Link Rot** (or linkrot) refers to the process by which hyperlinks on individual websites or the Internet in general point to web pages, servers or other resources that have become permanently unavailable.

We figured that process of Link Rot is actually present in the physical world too - that as culture, technology and people change, so to do their resources, directions, groundings and beliefs. We wanted to explore that space and that aspect of technology - how it actually influences and changes our lives. This isn't a discussion about processors or specifications - it's about how those things conspire to change our lives.

### The People

At the momemt the Link Rot team consists of [Tim Klapdor](https://twitter.com/timklapdor), [Adam Webster](https://twitter.com/adzawebster) and [Ben Atkinson](https://twitter.com/rockickarse). We work in different roles in education and technology in [Wagga Wagga, Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga) (the place so nice they named it twice). We're hoping to expand the voice you hear in the near future - getting guests in to discuss some of the big issues behind the technology.
