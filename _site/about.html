        <p>Link Rot is an experiment we’re running to explore the format of podcasting. We’re hugely interested in technology but also the impact that it’s having on our lives - and we wanted to talk about that. There’s something about a discuss that brings people together to jointly explore a topic. We can gain a different perspective, and there’s something more personal doing it through speech.</p>

<h3 id="the-name">The Name</h3>

<p>As Wikipedia puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Link Rot</strong> (or linkrot) refers to the process by which hyperlinks on individual websites or the Internet in general point to web pages, servers or other resources that have become permanently unavailable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We figured that process of Link Rot is actually present in the physical world too - that as culture, technology and people change, so to do their resources, directions, groundings and beliefs. We wanted to explore that space and that aspect of technology - how it actually influences and changes our lives. This isn’t a discussion about processors or specifications - it’s about how those things conspire to change our lives.</p>

<h3 id="the-people">The People</h3>

<p>At the momemt the Link Rot team consists of <a href="https://twitter.com/timklapdor">Tim Klapdor</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/adzawebster">Adam Webster</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rockickarse">Ben Atkinson</a>. We work in different roles in education and technology in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga">Wagga Wagga, Australia</a> (the place so nice they named it twice). We’re hoping to expand the voice you hear in the near future - getting guests in to discuss some of the big issues behind the technology.</p>
